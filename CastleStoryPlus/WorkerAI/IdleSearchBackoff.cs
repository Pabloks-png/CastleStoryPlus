// Idle workers ask every project for work each round of LookForWork, and the mod made those rounds five times as
// frequent (every 2 ticks instead of 10) so a worker picks up its next task at once. A worker with nothing to do kept
// asking at that pace for as long as it stood idle: a dozen idle workers cost close to a millisecond a frame finding
// nothing. A worker that has looked in vain for a while now asks less often: every round for the first ShortSeconds,
// every 3rd round until LongSeconds, then every 5th (about the game's own pace, some 0.4 s). The instinct (fights) is
// checked every round as before, and a worker coming off a task starts at full pace again.
