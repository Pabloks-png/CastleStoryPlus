// A worker that needs a resource (a builder's material, a workshop's ingredient) looks for the nearest thing holding
// it (Knowledge.ClosestObjectToPickup): every loose block, item and stockpile it can reach, of every resource. The game
// tested each one first for whether the worker's faction can see it and only then whether it holds the resource. The
// sight test is the costly one: a good on a pallet asks its pallet's sight in turn, with several component look-ups.
// So a search went through the sight of some 400 things to find the few holding the resource, close to 2 ms at once.
// Now the cheap tests come first (holds the resource, same or neutral faction) and only those that pass are tested for
// sight; the nearest is chosen with the game's own distance (a stockpile's pick-up bonus included), so the answer is
// the same.
